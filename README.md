# Odd-Even-Number-Detector-API
This is a basic API created using flask which will tell wether a number is even or odd on the browser in an 
interactive JSON object form


## Requirements
Python Version 3.9.1+

## Setup

Open any independent or IDE Based Terminal.

Then, navigate to that directory where repository is downloaded by using the command `cd directory-name` 


Then, inside the same terminal, write
```
cd Odd-Even-API
```


Then, after entering inside `Odd-Even-API` directory, we need to install flask.


To install flask, write 
```
pip install flask
```


## Running the Server

After installing flask, write

```
python basicrestapi.py
```
Now, the server will start running.

After running the server, we will get a localhost url link in the terminal for eg. http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Copy the link from the terminal and paste it in the browser and press enter key to open the Odd Even Detector website.
